 In this notebook, our goal is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of meteorological data for Traverse City. To achieve meaningful insights and build predictive models, we will follow a systematic approach to preprocess the data and engineer relevant features. Our primary focus will be on predicting precipitation based on various meteorological variables.
